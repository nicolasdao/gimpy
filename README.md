## Intro
I'm your gimp! I loves doing your painful chores like your project initilization, your deployments, etc. The more painful it is, the more likely I'll be "satisfied" :collision: :japanese_ogre: :japanese_ogre: :collision: :smiling_imp: :smiling_imp:.

> Whether you're a Dom or a Sub, I've got you covered you little Devil :smiling_imp:

_**If you're a Dom**_, I'm easy to use and you'll dominate me in no time :smoking:
. I'll let you mistreat me with all the chores you throw at me. I could for example set up a new GraphQL project fully functional and ready to be deployed to Google Cloud Functions (i.e. the Google serverless solution):

```
gimp new graphql-gcf SlapMeGraphQL
```

_**If you're a Sub**_, well it's time to make that botty dance and beg for work :collision:. Stop being a wuss and start creating templates to satisfied your Masters. I don't discriminate, so go on and create any type of nasty templates. From the a nasty Angular template to a dirty JQuery library. Do whatever you want you worm, as long as you publicly host them on GitHub using the naming convention: ```gimpy-template-[your-template-name]```

## Install
```
npm install gimpy -g
```
## How To Use It
#### Creating New Projects Using Templates Created By The Gimps

If you already know which template you want to use, simply run:
```
gimp new your-template your-project-name
```
Answer some questions and your done!!!

If you're looking for templates, you can list all the templates hosted on GitHub as follow:
```
gimp ls
```

Each template is cached as soon as you use it so next time will be faster. If you want to list all cached templates:
```
gimp cache
```

If you want to clear the cache:
```
gimp cache --clear
```
